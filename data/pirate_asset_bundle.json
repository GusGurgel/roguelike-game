  "raw_description": "\nThis map depicts a hidden pirate cove located inside a massive, partially\nflooded sea cave system. The terrain is a mix of natural wet rock formations and\nman-made wooden structures. Rickety wooden walkways and suspension bridges\nconnect isolated rock islands over dark, deep water, creating a verticality\nwhere falling means fighting aquatic monsters. The walls are irregular and damp,\ncovered in moss and glowing bioluminescent fungi.\n\nScattered throughout the cavern are wrecks of crashed ships that have been\nrepurposed into buildings, serving as shops or enemy barracks. The layout should\nfeel organic and somewhat chaotic, with secret alcoves hidden behind waterfalls\nand large open areas where the underground sea meets a sandy shore. The\ngeneration needs to balance dry land for combat and water tiles that hinder\nmovement, evoking the feeling of a treacherous hideout.\n",
  "description": "**1. Setting Name**  \n**The Siren’s Maw**\n\n**2. Visual Style & Atmosphere**  \nThe Siren’s Maw is a grim, maritime labyrinth where the sea never truly retreats. The art direction blends gritty, weather‑worn nautical architecture with a touch of eldritch wonder. Rivulets of phosphorescent sea‑fungi pulse along moss‑laden stone walls, casting an eerie blue glow that flickers against the dark, water‑logged corridors. The wooden walkways and suspension bridges are warped, splintered, and sagging from centuries of salt‑laden wind, their planks creaking ominously with every step. Water tiles shimmer with the faint, bioluminescent glow of planktonic life, while the deeper pools ripple with unseen currents.\n\nLighting is low and atmospheric—torches sputter, lanterns sputter, and the only other illumination comes from the fungi and occasional bioluminescent fish that drift by. The ambient soundscape is a constant, low hum of dripping water, the distant crash of waves against unseen rock, the creak of timber, and the muffled, resonant calls of deep‑sea creatures. Occasional gusts of wind carry the metallic tang of rust and the sharp scent of salt, punctuated by the distant, mournful wail of a sea‑bird. The mood is one of claustrophobic awe: a place where every shadow might conceal a trap, every creak could herald a lurking predator, and every step could plunge you into a watery abyss.\n\n**3. The Lore**  \nLong before the sea rose, the cavern was a dry, jagged outcrop that attracted a ragtag band of pirates known as the “Blue‑Skull Corsairs.” They carved a hidden cove out of the rock, building wooden walkways, bridges, and makeshift docks to keep their fleet concealed from the Royal Navy. Over the centuries, the tide grew higher, and the sea began to swallow the cavern’s lower chambers. The pirates, undeterred, repurposed the wrecks of their enemies and the ships that fell into the waters, turning them into fortified barracks, taverns, and black‑market stalls. Their ingenuity turned a natural cave into a sprawling, vertical city.\n\nThe flooding, however, unleashed a darkness. The sea’s ancient magic seeped into the stone, turning the moss into luminous fungi and the water into a living, sentient thing. The pirates soon discovered that the deeper they ventured, the more the water seemed to move of its own accord—currents that could drag a man to his doom in a heartbeat. Legends grew of a drowned captain, once the most feared pirate in the Caribbean, who fell into the cavern during a storm and was claimed by the sea. His spirit, now a towering Sea Wraith, commands the waters and the monsters that lurk beneath, feeding on the greed and blood of those who seek the treasure hidden within the Maw.\n\n**4. The Core Conflict**  \nAt the heart of the Siren’s Maw lies a living curse: the Sea Wraith, a colossal, drowned pirate lord who has become a spectral tyrant. He controls the tides, summons aquatic monsters, and manipulates the cavern’s architecture—sliding stone walls, flooding corridors, and spawning deadly water currents. The Wraith’s ultimate goal is to reclaim the treasure he lost, and he will not rest until the Maw is sealed from the world above.\n\nPlayers confront this threat in a multi‑layered battle: they must navigate the treacherous, water‑laden labyrinth, avoid or defeat the Wraith’s aquatic minions, and unravel the secrets of the cavern’s ancient curse. The core conflict is not just a fight against a single enemy but a struggle against an ever‑changing environment that punishes missteps with drowning, falling, or being swallowed by the sea’s hungry maw. The only way to survive is to master the verticality, harness the bioluminescent fungi’s strange powers, and ultimately decide whether to break the curse or become the next chapter in the Siren’s Maw’s dark legend.",

When the sea rose, the Captain’s soul was trapped within this orb, binding the cavern’s waters to his will and giving rise to the Sea Wraith’s relentless curse. The Heart is the source of the Maw’s living corruption: it feeds on the greed of intruders, summons the ocean’s monsters, and manipulates the very stone to drown all who dare seek its treasure. Only by retrieving the Siren’s Heart and returning it to the surface can the curse be broken, the Wraith’s spectral reign ended, and the cavern’s waters be freed from its eternal torment. Leaving the Heart behind would allow the Wraith to grow stronger, sealing the Maw forever and turning all who venture below into new victims of the sea’s hunger.",
